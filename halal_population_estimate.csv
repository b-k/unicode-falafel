# We were unable to find a large-scale and unbiased survey that directly asks for
# halal preferences, but the Pew Forum survey cited in the proposal asks a number of
# questions about levels of religious observance, and of those offered, we chose to base
# our estimate on the question ``Do you favor\dots making \dots Islamic law the law of
# the land in our country?'' (p 201). A person who responds yes to this question seems
# likely to keep halal (or at least presents as such in public communication). In fact,
# one may consider this opinion to be rather far beyond the much smaller question of
# eating halal, but that means our calculation is conservative and the true count of
# those who would prefer falafel over shrimp or glasses of cocktails is larger than the
# total calculated here.
# 
# We multiplied the per-country percentage of people who said yes to this broad question
# by estimates of the Muslim population in these countries. Due to time constraints,
# population counts were taken from the Wikipedia aggregation, disregarding year of
# survey and reliability estimates, which we feel will still be sufficient for the
# order-of-magnitude estimate here. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_by_country .
#
# Below is a comma-separated list of the Pew percentage who said yes to the above
# question (times 100), the Muslim population count from Wikipedia, and the
# percentage times the population. There is a row with the totals at the bottom.
